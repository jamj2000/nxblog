# NextJS Blob example with SSG
**Static Site Generation**

> Typical example of blog generated at build time.



If a page uses Static Generation, the page HTML is **generated at build time**. That means in production, the page HTML is generated when you **`run next build`**. This HTML will then be reused on each request. It can be cached by a CDN.
